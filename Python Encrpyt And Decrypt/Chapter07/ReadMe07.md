## Permutation Cipher


**Substitution Cipher** 

This involves replacing each letter or symbol in the plaintext with another letter or symbol.

A common example is the Caesar cipher, where each letter is shifted by a fixed number.

**Permutation Cipher** 

 This involves rearranging the order of the letters or symbols in the plaintext, rather than 
 
 substituting them. A common example is the columnar transposition cipher, where characters 
 
 are rearranged based on a key.
